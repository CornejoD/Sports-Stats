# NBA Game Hub

# Description

This is the NBA Game Hub, a website that utilizes two NBA APIs, demonstrating the skills we have learned in the last six modules. When the website is loaded, the user is greeted with a header at the top, featuring the logo, slogan, and a link to the NBA Twitter page. In the middle-left area, users can search for any NBA team, and the six box containers in the middle will update with the upcoming games, starting with the earliest date. These containers also display team logos and names, listed in order from the home team to the visitor team.

The top right corner contains a container that provides users with instructions on how to use the search bar, while the bottom right corner displays the top three teams at the time. This information updates dynamically based on the NBA standings API and will change depending on the current standings.

This website is an easy and conient way for people to access info about dates for any team alongisde the leaderboard.
