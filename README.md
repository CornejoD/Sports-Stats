# NBA Game Hub

# Description

This is NBA Game hub, a website utilizing two NBA APIs, demonstating the skills we learned in the last 6 modules. When the webside is loaded, the user is met with the header at the top, with the Logo, slogan, and link to the NBA twiter page. Then on the middle left area, the user is able to look up any NBA team, in which the 6 bon containers in the middle will update with the upcoming games starting with the earliest date. This will give logo and team names as well, in order from home to visitor. 

The top right has a container which gives the user a description on how to use the search bar, and on the bottom right there is the top 3 teams at the time. This updates according to the NBA standings API, and will remain changing depending on the current standings. 

This website is an easy and conient way for people to access info about dates for any team alongisde the leaderboard.
